2. Create API Key â†’ Copy it
3. Keep this for later (we'll get the Endpoint ID after deployment)

**Save these somewhere safe!**

---

## Phase 3: Deploy Backend (15 minutes)

### On Your Computer:

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd editto-mvp

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create GitHub repo (if you have GitHub CLI)
gh repo create editto-mvp --public --source=. --push

# Or push manually:
# 1. Create repo on GitHub website
# 2. git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/editto-mvp.git
# 3. git push -u origin main
```

### On Railway:

1. Go to railway.app dashboard
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select `editto-mvp`
4. Click "+ New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
5. Click "+ New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Redis"
6. Click on the backend service
7. Settings â†’ Root Directory â†’ Set to `/backend`
8. Settings â†’ Environment Variables â†’ Add:

```
R2_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
R2_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=editto-videos
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-YOUR_ID.r2.dev
RUNPOD_API_KEY=your_key_here
RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID=we_will_set_this_later
```

9. Copy your Railway backend URL (e.g., `editto-backend.up.railway.app`)

---

## Phase 4: Deploy Frontend (10 minutes)

### On Vercel:

1. Go to vercel.com dashboard
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Import `editto-mvp` from GitHub
4. Configure:
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
5. Environment Variables â†’ Add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.up.railway.app
```

6. Click "Deploy"
7. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
8. Copy your Vercel URL (e.g., `editto-mvp.vercel.app`)

---

## Phase 5: Setup GPU Worker (20 minutes)

### Build Docker Image (on your computer):

```bash
# Install Docker first if you haven't
# Download from docker.com

# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Build and push
cd gpu-worker

# Edit build.sh - change DOCKER_USERNAME to yours
# Then run:
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will take 10-15 minutes to build and push.

### Create RunPod Endpoint:

1. Go to runpod.io â†’ Serverless
2. Click "New Endpoint"
3. Configure:
   - Name: `editto-worker`
   - Select: **RTX A6000 (48GB)**
   - Container Image: `your-dockerhub-username/editto-worker:latest`
   - Container Disk: 20GB
   - Env Variables:
     ```
     R2_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
     R2_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
     R2_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     R2_BUCKET_NAME=editto-videos
     R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-YOUR_ID.r2.dev
     ```
4. Deploy
5. Copy the **Endpoint ID**

### Update Railway:

1. Go back to Railway backend
2. Update environment variable:
   ```
   RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID=your_actual_endpoint_id
   ```

---

## Phase 6: Test It! (5 minutes)

1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. Upload a short test video (keep it under 10MB)
3. Enter instruction: "make it black and white"
4. Click "Upload & Edit Video"
5. Watch the "Your Videos" section
6. Refresh after 30 seconds to see status

**Note:** The GPU worker currently has placeholder code. It won't actually edit the video yet - you need to implement the Editto inference code.

---

## What You've Built

âœ… Frontend hosted on Vercel (FREE)
âœ… Backend API on Railway ($5/month)
âœ… Database on Railway (included)
âœ… Redis queue on Railway (included)
âœ… Video storage on Cloudflare R2 (FREE up to 10GB)
âœ… GPU processing on RunPod ($0.50/hour when running)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:

1. **Test with a real video** - Upload and check status
2. **Monitor costs** - Check RunPod dashboard
3. **Verify storage** - Check videos appear in R2 bucket

### Soon:

1. **Implement actual Editto inference** - The GPU worker currently just copies the video
2. **Add authentication** - So not everyone can use your GPU
3. **Set usage limits** - Protect against abuse
4. **Improve UI** - Make it prettier

### Before Going Public:

1. âœ… Implement real video editing (Editto model)
2. âœ… Add user authentication
3. âœ… Add rate limiting
4. âœ… Set up monitoring
5. âœ… Test thoroughly
6. âœ… Add terms of service

---

## Cost Reminders

- **RunPod charges per second** of GPU use
- A 4-minute video processing = $0.03 (at $0.50/hour)
- 100 videos/day = ~$3/day = $90/month
- **Set up spending limits in RunPod!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Backend not responding"
- Check Railway backend is running
- Visit `https://your-backend.railway.app/health`
- Check environment variables are set

### "Video upload fails"
- Check R2 credentials
- Verify bucket name is correct
- Check bucket has public access

### "Docker build fails"
- Ensure Docker is installed and running
- Check you have enough disk space (need ~10GB)
- Try: `docker system prune -a` to free space

### "RunPod endpoint not working"
- Check container logs in RunPod dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check image was pushed to Docker Hub successfully

## Need Help?

1. Check the main README.md for detailed troubleshooting
2. Check service-specific documentation:
   - Railway: docs.railway.app
   - Vercel: vercel.com/docs
   - RunPod: docs.runpod.io
3. Review Editto repo: github.com/EzioBy/Ditto
