## Variable Costs (The Big One)

### RunPod: $0.50/hour for A6000 GPU

**This is where costs vary based on usage!**

#### Calculation:
- **Per video:** ~4 minutes on A6000
- **Cost per video:** 4 min × ($0.50/60 min) = **$0.033 per video**
- **Or:** ~30 videos per $1

#### Real-World Scenarios:

| Daily Videos | Processing Time | Monthly Cost | Use Case |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 video | 4 min/day | $4/month | Personal testing |
| 5 videos | 20 min/day | $20/month | Small project |
| 10 videos | 40 min/day | $40/month | Growing app |
| 20 videos | 80 min/day | $80/month | Active users |
| 50 videos | 200 min/day | $200/month | Popular app |
| 100 videos | 400 min/day | $400/month | High traffic |

---

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Start Small
- Test with short videos first
- Monitor costs daily initially
- Set RunPod spending alerts

### 2. Optimize Video Processing
- Compress videos before processing
- Limit max video length (e.g., 30 seconds)
- Charge users for longer videos

### 3. Use Idle Times
- Process during off-peak hours (if cheaper)
- Batch multiple jobs together
- Cache popular editing styles

### 4. Set Limits
- Max uploads per user per day
- Max video size (MB)
- Max video length (seconds)
- Queue limits

### 5. Monitor Usage
- Check RunPod dashboard daily
- Set up alerts at $10, $25, $50
- Review Railway usage weekly
- Track R2 storage growth

## Pricing Comparison

### GPU Options (per hour):

| GPU | VRAM | RunPod Cost | Processing Time | Cost per Video |
|-----|------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **RTX A6000** | 48GB | $0.50/hr | ~4 min | $0.033 |
| RTX 4090 | 24GB | $0.39/hr | ~5 min | $0.032 |
| RTX 3090 | 24GB | $0.29/hr | ~5-6 min | $0.025 |
| A100 (80GB) | 80GB | $1.89/hr | ~2-3 min | $0.095 |

**Recommendation:** Start with A6000 for reliability, test cheaper GPUs later.

## Hidden Costs to Watch

### 1. Development Time
- Your time setting this up
- Learning curve
- Debugging issues

### 2. Overages
- Railway: If you exceed $5 credit
- R2: If you exceed 10GB
- RunPod: Forgetting to set limits

### 3. Failed Jobs
- If a job fails halfway, you still pay
- Implement good error handling
- Test thoroughly before production

### 4. Egress on Railway
- API responses count toward bandwidth
- Large video URLs in responses add up
- Use pagination for job lists

---

## When to Upgrade

### Upgrade Railway ($20/month Pro) when:
- You need team collaboration
- Backend needs more resources
- Exceeding $5 credit regularly

### Upgrade Vercel ($20/month Pro) when:
- Going commercial (Hobby is personal only)
- Need team features
- Exceeding 100GB bandwidth

### Consider Dedicated GPU when:
- Processing 50+ videos daily consistently
- Need guaranteed availability
- Want 24/7 uptime

**Dedicated GPU costs:**
- A6000 dedicated: ~$300-400/month
- Better than $0.50/hr if you're using 600+ hours/month

---

## Profit Calculation (If Charging Users)

### Break-even Analysis:

If you charge users $0.10 per video edit:

| Videos/Day | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Cost | Profit |
|------------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| 10 | $30 | $25 | $5 |
| 50 | $150 | $90 | $60 |
| 100 | $300 | $165 | $135 |
| 200 | $600 | $320 | $280 |

**Note:** This is simplified. Factor in payment processing fees (Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30), taxes, etc.

## Setting RunPod Spending Limits

### How to Protect Your Wallet:

1. Go to RunPod → Settings → Billing
2. Set up spending alerts:
   - $10 warning
   - $25 warning
   - $50 critical
3. Set max spending limit: $100/month (or your budget)
4. Enable email notifications
5. Check dashboard daily initially

### Auto-Shutdown Settings:

Configure your endpoint to:
- Idle Timeout: 60 seconds (stops GPU when not in use)
- Max Execution Time: 10 minutes (prevents runaway jobs)
- Max Queue Size: 10 (limits concurrent jobs)

## Red Flags (Stop & Check!)

🚨 **Stop immediately if:**
- RunPod costs > $5/day unexpectedly
- Railway exceeds $5 credit in first week
- R2 storage grows > 1GB/day
- Getting errors but still charged

**Action:**
1. Pause new uploads
2. Check for bugs/loops
3. Review logs
4. Contact support if needed

---

## Final Thoughts

**Start small.** You can run this MVP for $10-30/month while testing.

**Scale gradually.** Double usage every 2-3 weeks, not overnight.

**Monitor daily.** Check costs every day for the first month.

**Set limits.** Use spending alerts and caps religiously.

**Be ready to pivot.** If costs spike, pause and optimize.

## Cost Tracking Spreadsheet

Create a simple sheet:

| Date | Videos Processed | RunPod Cost | Railway Cost | R2 Cost | Total | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|---------|-------|-------|
| May 1 | 2 | $0.07 | $0.17 | $0 | $0.24 | Testing |
| May 2 | 5 | $0.17 | $0.17 | $0 | $0.34 | Beta users |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Track for a month to understand your actual costs.

---

**Remember:** The GPU cost ($0.50/hr) is the main variable. Everything else is predictable and cheap. Control your GPU usage, and you control your costs!

Good luck! 💰✨
